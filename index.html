        <h3>Harvest</h3>
        <p class="unbold">Harvest is an application that uses AI (machine vision) to enable users to easily capture and organize information from across devices and platforms. Harvest lets you take screenshots or photos of anything - recipes, books, signs, events, locations - and automatically extracts the key details to create clean records that are then logged to a vector store for semantic retrieval.</p>
        <p class="unbold">As technical lead and product strategist, I oversaw development of Harvest's core image processing and machine learning capabilities, as well as app development. I crafted an intuitive user flow that made it effortless to build a personal knowledge base from daily life. My strategies shaped core product directions - focusing first on privacy-preserving on-device processing, and emphasizing speed and utility over complex social features. </p>
        <p>The app is currently not public and in beta-testing, so please contact me directly for more information.</p>

        <h3>ToftH Research</h3>
        <p class="unbold">At the ToftH Research corporation, I led teams that strategized with R&D units at Meta, Microsoft, and Google. </p>
        <p class="unbold">We delivered impact on projects about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Musical collaboration with AI (Meta/FAIR)</li>
          <li>AI-powered virtual assistants (Meta/FAIR)</li>
          <li>Co-cogitation with AI (Microsoft)</li>
          <li>The structure of information on the internet (Google)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="unbold">Upon completion of these projects, they were lifted from their AI research labs and prioritized in the product development pipeline.</p>
        <p class="unbold">Our research method integrates artistic experimentation and software prototyping to help cross-functional teams develop new product categories that leverage AI breakthroughs. </p>

      </p>
      <div class="bio" style="display: none;">
        <p>I grew up in the Boston suburbs. I love running around Walden Pond and on the trails of the Lincoln woods.</p>
        <p>I studied a combination of philosophy, history, and economics at Berkeley. During these years I also spent a lot of time in China, for work and to study the language. After graduating, I taught cross-country at my high school, and then moved to London to make music with my friends.</p>
        <p>Beginning in 2020, I studied law and philosophy at Peking University and received an LL.M (ha) in 2022. Due to COVID lockdowns, I never visited the campus, and instead used my stipend to live in New York City, teach myself how to code, read philosophy books, and make music.</p>
        <p>I moved back to the Bay in 2021 and worked at a start-up. We used an experimental method of artistic practice and technological prototyping to help tech companies see how LLM breakthroughs can change their product lines. I left in June of 2023 and helped a friend co-found a start-up by working on the build and strategy until we closed a seed round. Since then, I have continued my prototyping and product concept efforts.</p>
        <p>Catch me running around Lake Merritt on sunny afternoons.</p>
