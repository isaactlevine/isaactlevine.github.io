tl;dr: 

This brief, speculative essay is an attempt to provoke our theories of information, and I wish to do so by distinguishing ümwelt information from discursive information. 
<br>
<br>
Ümwelt information is information that temporarily or permanently alters the experiential and sensory quality of one’s being-in-the-world, either by placing one in a novel world or by producing highly legible vicariousness with another human or non-human. 
<br>
<br>
This stands in contrast to our legacy genre of information, which we can call discursive information for now; this is the type of information that is about communicating explicit content: facts, opinions, empirical findings, code, and so on. Ümwelt information exists prior to the emergence of explicit content in a given context, and in fact constitutes much of its production. 
<br>
<br>
The main frontiers of contemporary technology – machine learning, cryptographic protocols, and VR/metaverses – all potentiate forms of ümwelt information, including sensory translation and generative representations, algorithmic choice, and experiential immersion, respectively. 
<br>
<br>
I suggest that designing technical/hard protocols and speculating on soft protocols for ümwelt information will raise this question and hopefully begin answering it:How do information protocols shape and transform our cognitive landscapes and patterns (collectively, within communities, and as individuals), and what are the implications of this on our collective sense-making processes and construction of ‘world’?
<br>
<br>
A good starting point would be to study how technical discursive information protocols like SMTP and TCP/IP may or may not have had cascading effects on the way we experience information (likely) and in turn on our cognition and how we think (unclear). Then, we can extrapolate out and see if porting different sensorial, experiential, or algorithmic data from user-to-user might affect how we cognize others (whether they are human or non-human) and the worlds they (and we) inhabit.
<br>
<br>
As an example, might we build a protocol for sharing and communicating the qualia/affordances of algorithmic feeds? What would it share/display? What effect would that have on how we think and experience each other?
<br>
<br>
Last year I saw this tweet from philosopher Yuk Hui:
<br>
<br>
It was provocative but nevertheless unclear, and as a result lingered in my head over the subsequent months with little development of a novel idea/theory. 
<br>
<br>
It was not until at work, when I began researching communication on networks/protocols, that I found one possible entry point. 
<br>
<br>
My research then was hitting upon some of the usual beats: communication has shifted with technological infrastructure changes since the early 1990s, e.g:
<br>
<br>
* from few-to-many to many-to-many communications
* from place-based communication to place-agnostic communication
<br>
<br>
However, little could be said of what was communicated and why/how that changed. Were these changes above not accompanied by a transformation in what information is and what is communicated? I suspected not.
<br>
<br>
At this point, my research at work -- where I study machine learning and crypto -- pivoted towards understanding the At Protocol at Bluesky led by Jay Graber. I was particularly drawn to their goal of implementing algorithmic choice, that is, the mechanism by which people can select different and curated media feeds on social media platforms. One interesting implementation of a proto-version of this is over at Vicariously, which allows users to see the Twitter feed of another user based on who they follow.
<br>
<br>
What is striking about algorithmic choice and tinkerer projects like Vicariously is that they operate prior to information: they constitute the basic conditions of receiving information as if one is not oneself anymore. These infrastructures, in other words, produce a different and novel experiential endowment for the user.
<br>
<br>
Immediately what sprang to mind was the concept of ümwelts, defined by Jakob von Uexküll as the "biological foundations that lie at the very center of the study of both communication and signification in the human [and non-human] animal." My main referent for this concept was actually Pierre Huyghe’s exhibition, UUmwelt, which used the generative capacities of ML to create images from MRIs and “an ensemble of intelligences, of entities biotic or abiotic.” 
<br>
<br>
If both machine learning and crypto/protocol projects were producing information on the plane of experiences and senses, then perhaps what I was witnessing was something novel, tentatively named “ümwelt information,” and a new genre of information itself. 
<br>
<br>
VR/AR/Metaverses quickly joined the bunch: clearly they inhere experiential and sensory information as much as any other technology. 
<br>
<br>
As an exercise I attempted a quadrant for ümwelt information so as to approach a tentative heuristic/definition of what it might actually mean. I arrived at the following:
<br>
<br>
Let’s dive into a few examples. 
<br>
<br>
Skeuomorphic metaverses are highly immersive and can give users the vicarious experience of being another user by porting into their avatar. 
<br>
<br>
‘Other worldly metaverses’ are similar, although human users can experience the sensory endowment of, say, a whale or a bird. 
<br>
<br>
Mechanistic interpretability, like the research done at AI labs like Anthropic, seek to metaphorically place machine learning systems under an MRI to get a better sense of how their emergent faculties are possible and how they work. In essence, this line of research is trying to understand how an ML system thinks. It is thinking as an ‘other’ thinks, although not immersive.
<br>
<br>
Algorithmic choice/appropriation is the practice of using another person’s particular and bespoke algorithmic feeds to experience the content they consume as they would. It is a way of glimpsing at their own ‘infosphere,’ making it a vicarious experience of another human. I hesitate to call this immersive, though, as the infosphere of any given individual is not limited to algorithmically curated information.
<br>
<br>
Based on this mapping, I settled on this definition:
<br>
<br>
ümwelt information is information that temporarily or permanently alters the experiential and sensory quality of one’s being in a world, either by placing one in a novel world (immersive/non-immersive) or by producing highly legible vicariousness with another (human/non-human).
<br>
<br>
In other words, ümwelt information is “the difference that makes a difference” with respect to sensory endowments, experiential cognition, and algorithmic affordances.
<br>
<br>
This stands in contrast to our legacy genre of information, which we can call discursive information ; this is the type of information that is about communicating explicit content: facts, opinions, empirical findings, code, and so on. We can think of newspapers, forums, websites, journal articles, code, TV and radio broadcasts, and so on. While there are some mediums here that move into the realm of ümwelt information, like novels, their lasting effect and reproducibility is limited.
<br>
<br>
Ümwelt information exists prior to the emergence of explicit content in a given context, and in fact constitutes much of its production. For a crude diagram I put together attempting to show this relation and change over time, see below:
<br>
<br>
The value in attending to ümwelt information rests in its ability to get us to not only think about the transformations to our experiential cognition, sensory endowments, and media diets/feeds, but to think about how to produce infrastructures for them.
<br>
<br>
That is, to the extent that there are infrastructures with unique and often generative and interesting affordances for discursive information (internet protocols, books, newsletters, blogs, etc.), so too could it be the case for ümwelt information. Much more work and thinking on the varieties of ümwelt information and their technical underpinnings is needed first.
<br>
<br>
However, if the diversification of information in such a way is to be taken seriously, then we should consider the potential for protocols to make building systems in terms of ümwelt information more probable. More importantly, thinking about what protocols can do for ümwelt information might help us navigate a very important question:
<br>
<br>
How do information protocols shape and transform our cognitive landscapes and patterns (collectively, within communities, and as individuals), and what are the implications of this on our collective sense-making processes and construction of ‘world’?
<br>
<br>
A good starting point would be to study how technical discursive information protocols like SMTP and TCP/IP may or may not have cascading effects on the way we consume information and in turn on our cognition. Then, we can extrapolate out and see if porting different sensorial, experiential, or algorithmic data from user-to-user might affect how we cognize others (whether they are human or non-human) and the worlds they (and we) inhabit.
<br>
<br>
As an example, might we build a protocol for sharing the qualia of algorithmic feeds? What would it share/display? What effect would that have on how we interact on the internet?
<br>
<br>
In the next iteration of this research, this is where we’ll start."
